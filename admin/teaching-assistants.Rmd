   - Coordinate and teach study cafés.
   - Read syllabus and calculate and check each week's exercises.
   - Provide help for project reports (week 41 and 49).
   - Report errors, typos etc. (you may use GitHub).
   - Teach a lecture (week 42). Use it as independent teaching in PhDPlanner. 
   - Check and answer questions at the [course help page](https://github.com/bss-osca/tfa/issues). Do NOT accept and give answers using mail. Instead kindly direct them to the help page.  
   
Expect that more help is needed in the project report weeks. NOTE study café is moved in Week 40 so two study cafés in Week 41. You can always check your schedule at [https://timetable.au.dk/schedule](https://timetable.au.dk/schedule).
