## Mutating joins

Mutating joins allow you to combine variables from multiple tables. There are different types of joins. We will consider:

- `inner_join()`: all rows from x where there are matching values in y, return 
all combination of multiple matches in the case of multiple matches
- `left_join()`: all rows from x
- `right_join()`: all rows from y
- `full_join()`: all rows from both x and y

While mutating joins are primarily used to add new variables, they can also generate new observations. If a match is not unique, a join will add all possible combinations (the Cartesian product) of the matching observations.

## Setup

For the next few slides...

.pull-left[
```{r}
band_members
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
band_instruments
```
]

---

## `inner_join()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
band_members %>% 
  inner_join(band_instruments)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("img/inner-join.gif")
```
]

---

## `left_join()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
band_members %>% 
  left_join(band_instruments)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("img/left-join.gif")
```
]

---

## `right_join()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
band_members %>%
  right_join(band_instruments)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("img/right-join.gif")
```
]

---

## `full_join()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
band_members %>% 
  full_join(band_instruments)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("img/full-join.gif")
```
]

## Filtering joins

Filtering joins match observations in the same way as mutating joins, but affect the observations, not the variables. There are two types:

- `semi_join()`: all rows from x where there are matching values in y, keeping just columns from x.
- `anti_join()`: return all rows from x where there are not matching values in y, never duplicate rows of x
 
These are most useful for diagnosing join mismatches. If you're worried about what observations your joins will match, start with a `semi_join()` or `anti_join()`. `semi_join()` and `anti_join()` never duplicate; they only remove observations.

## `semi_join()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
band_members %>% 
  semi_join(band_instruments)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("img/semi-join.gif")
```
]

---

## `anti_join()`

.pull-left[
```{r}
band_members %>% 
  anti_join(band_instruments)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("img/anti-join.gif")
```
]

---

## What if column names are not the same?

.pull-left[
```{r}
band_members
band_instruments2
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
band_members %>% 
  full_join(
    band_instruments2, 
    by = c("name" = "artist"))
```
]
