## The tidyverse package

The [tidyverse][tidyverse-main-page] is a collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. The main packages are loaded using `library(tidyverse)`. We focus on

  * [readr][tidyverse-readr] provides a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data (like csv, tsv, and fwf). 
  * [dplyr][tidyverse-dplyr] provides a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that solve the most common data manipulation challenges.
  * [ggplot2][tidyverse-ggplot2] is a system for declaratively creating graphics.
  * [tidyr][tidyverse-tidyr] provides a set of functions that help you get to tidy data. Tidy data is data with a consistent form: in brief, every variable goes in a column, and every column is a variable. 
  * [tibble][tidyverse-tibble] is a modern re-imagining of the data frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what has not.

Small introductions (with examples) to the packages are given on their documentation pages.

## Writing reproducible reports

  - Reproducible means that the results can be reproduced given access to the original data, software, and code. 
  - In practice it may be hard to make your project totally reproducible. There are different levels of reproducibility.
  - [Literate programming][wiki-literate-programming] a programming paradigm focusing on weaving code together with text as documentation. 
  - Want to write reports containing both R code for importing data, wrangling and analysis with comments about the code, plots, analysis, results, etc. 
  - Focus on [R Markdown][r-markdown]. In R Markdown documents you can weave R code together with text (written in Markdown) to produce rendered output in html, pdf or Word. 
  - This may seem complicated at first. However, after setup, it makes life much easier, since don't have to copy/paste anymore.

## Example 

Let us have a look at an example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bss-osca/tfa/master/slides/03-transform/03-transform_examples.Rmd"
download.file(url, 
              "03-transform_ex.Rmd",   # stores file in R working directory
              mode="w")                # "w" means "write," and is used for text files
```

We will use this file throughout the lecture. Let us try to knit the document in different formats.

## Input and output

  * For doing data driven analytics you first must import some data. That is, take data from a database, file, web API etc. and transform it into a data frame/table. 
  * Two main types of data files. Information is either binary encoded or stored as text files. 
  * Text files can be read by humans and any programming language. 
  * Binary file formats cannot be read by humans but allows space-efficient data compression. Moreover they can be used to save non tabular data.
  * CSV files contain delimiter separated values (e.g. `,`, `;` or `_`) in plain text and are often named using the file suffix `.csv`. 
  * The [readxl][tidyverse-readxl] package can be used to read Excel files. Write to an Excel file  using the [openxlsx][pkg-openxlsx] package. 
  * You can import and export to Google sheets using the [googlesheets4][tidyverse-googlesheets4] package. 
  * Json is an open standard text file format, and data interchange format. It can be used to store non tabular data in text format.

**Characteristics of tidy data:**

- Each variable forms a column.
- Each observation forms a row.
- Each type of observational unit forms a table.

.question[
What makes this data not tidy?
]

<br>

```{r hiv-est-prevalence-15-49, echo=FALSE, out.width="95%", fig.align = "center", caption = "Estimated HIV prevalence among 15-49 year olds"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/hiv-est-prevalence-15-49.png")
```

## Summary tables 

.question[
Is each of the following a dataset or a summary table?
]

.midi[
.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE}
starwars %>%
  select(name, height, mass)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
starwars %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarize(
    avg_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE) %>% round(2)
  )
```
]
]

## A grammar of data wrangling...

... based on the concepts of functions as verbs that manipulate data frames

.pull-left[
```{r dplyr-part-of-tidyverse, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align = "center", caption = "dplyr is part of the tidyverse"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dplyr-part-of-tidyverse.png")
```
]
.pull-right[
.midi[
- `select`: pick columns by name
- `arrange`: reorder rows
- `slice`: pick rows using index(es)
- `filter`: pick rows matching criteria
- `distinct`: filter for unique rows
- `mutate`: add new variables
- `summarise`: reduce variables to values
- `group_by`: for grouped operations
- ... (many more)
]

## Rules of **dplyr** functions

- First argument is *always* a data frame
- Subsequent arguments say what to do with that data frame
- Always return a data frame

## Data: Hotel bookings

- Data from two hotels: one resort and one city hotel
- Observations: Each row represents a hotel booking
<!-- - Goal for original data collection: Development of prediction models to classify a hotel booking's likelihood to be cancelled ([Antonia et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191#bib5)) -->

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
hotels <- read_csv(system.file("extdata/hotels.csv", package = "tfa"))
hotels
```

## Your Turn

.your-turn[
- Create a function that calculates the present value ($PV$) of a future value. The equation is: 
$$PV = FV/(1+r)^n$$ where $FV$ is future value, $r$ is the interest rate, and $n$ is the number of periods. 
- Input arguments must be $FV$, $r$, $n$ and a boolean `round` equal true if the output should be rounded to two decimals. 
- The default interest rate is 0.1 (10%) and rounding is false by default.
]

```{r echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 5)

```{r, include=FALSE}
get_PV <- function(FV, r = 0.1, n, round = FALSE) {
  PV <- FV/(1+r)^n
  if (round) return(round(PV, 2))
  return(PV)
