## What is Business Analytics

- Business Analytics (BA) (or just Analytics) refers to the scientific process of transforming data into insight for making better decisions in business. 
--

- BA can both be seen as the complete decision making process for solving a business problem and the creation of business value by integration of concepts, methods and data.
--

- As a process, it can be characterized by descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive model building using data sources. For a full definition see the appendix in the course notes.
--

- Data science is an interdisciplinary field about scientific methods, processes, and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured and can be seen as Business analytics applied to a wider range of data.

## Analytics as a data driven process

.pull-left[
- First you must __import__ your data. 
&lt;!-- That is, take data from a database, file, web API etc. and transform it into a data frame/table.  --&gt;
- Next you must get your data in the right form (__wrangling__).
&lt;!-- - In general raw data may be messy and need to be structured in a __tidy__ way.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Tidying your data means storing it in a structured form sutaiable for analysis. In brief, when your data is __tidy__, each column is a variable, and each row is an observation. Tidy data is important because the consistent structure lets you focus your struggle on questions about the data.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- - Once you have tidy data, a common first step is to __transform__ it.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Transformation includes narrowing in on observations of interest (e.g. only observations from a specific year or warehouse), creating new variables based on existing variables (like the cost of using the machine that day given idle time).  --&gt;
- Exploration, visualization and modeling may be seen as different steps which can be used for __analyzing__ the data and answer the overall questions. 
&lt;!-- This part of the course will focus on the different steps except modeling.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- - The next step is to do a simple __exploration__ of you data such as calculating a set of summary statistics (like counts, means or KPIs).  --&gt;
&lt;!-- A good way to get an overview over your data is by __visualisation__.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- A good visualisation will show you things that you did not expect, raise new questions about the data or confirm your hypotesis. A good visualisation might also hint that you're asking the wrong question, or you need to collect different data. Exploration and visusalization are descriptive analytics and used to answer questions such as: What happend? How many, how often, where? Where exactly is the problem? What actions are needed? --&gt;
&lt;!-- - __Models__ are complementary tools to visualisation. Once you have made your questions sufficiently precise, you can use a model to answer them. A model is a description of a system using mathematical concepts and a simplification of the real system. That is, the results of a model are based on a set of assumptions. Models for statistical analysis, forecasting, system behaivior are predictive analytics and answer questions like: Why is this happening? What if these trends continue? What will happen next? Models for prescriptive analytics use optimization and other decision modelling techniques to suggest decision options with the goal of improving business performance and answer questions like: What is the best that can happen? --&gt;
- Given an analysis you must __communicate__ the results to decision makers. 
&lt;!-- Note that analytics is not a one-way process, is is common that you several times have to tidy and transform your data, explore and visualize based on the results of a model, rerun the model given feedback on you communication to the decision makers etc. Common connections are visualized using directed arrows in Figure \@ref(fig:process).  --&gt;
- Surrounding the process is __programming__ (your Swiss army knife). 
&lt;!-- An introduction to programming is given in the first part of the course using VBA in Excel. We will cover programming using R in this part of the course. --&gt;

## Course notes (.small[[bss-osca.github.io/tfa/](https://bss-osca.github.io/tfa/)])

The book consists of different parts each containing teaching modules about specific topics:

* Part I - Getting started.
* Part II - Programming in R.
* Part III - Import/export, tidy and transformation of data.
* Part IV - Visualization of data.
* Part V - R project presents your mandatory R project.
* Part VI - Extra modules that may be useful during your study (not part of the curriculum). 
* Appendix - Different modules that may be helpful for you including hints on how to __work in groups__, __how to get help__ if you are stuck and __how to annotate the course notes__.

---

## Teaching style

- The course is on-line.
- Flipped classroom. Lots of learn-by-doing.
- Interactive tutorials at DataCamp. Remember to sign up!
- Live on-line lecture of approx. one hour (see the schedule). 
- The on-line lecture should be seen as a supplement to the teaching notes. 
- You must have completed the learning modules before the lecture and started to look at the exercises. 
- Different learning paths are provided at each module. 
- Study cafés (as in the VBA part). Try to solve the exercises before the café.

&lt;!-- ## Sharing/reusing code --&gt;

&lt;!-- - I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. --&gt;
&lt;!-- - Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, you can use any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow, RStudio Community) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration).  --&gt;
&lt;!-- - On individual assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- - Except for the take home exams, you are welcome to discuss the problems together and ask for advice, but you may not send or make use of code from another team. --&gt;

## R

- R is a programming language and free software environment.
- You must have R and RStudio installed on your computer.
- Assume that you are using R via RStudio (an IDE). 
- R is like a car's engine while RStudio is like a car's dashboard.

## R vs Excel/VBA

- Excel
  * Initial learning curve is quite minimal.
  * Analysis can be done via point-and-click. 
  * It's not exceedingly hard to make basic graphs and charts. 
- R
  * A programming language, meaning the initial learning curve is steeper. 
  * Use command-line or script file.
  * It will take you some time to become familiar with the interface and master the various functions. 
- VBA
  * Compiled language.

## R basics

Basic use of R

```r
8738787213 / 1653   # as a calculator
```

```
## [1] 5286623
```

```r
"Lars"  # a character/string
```

```
## [1] "Lars"
```

```r
c(1,4)  # a vector
```

```
## [1] 1 4
```

```r
1:4 # a vector (sequence)
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3 4
```

---

## R basics


```r
age &lt;- c(12, 56, 34)  # assignment to object 
name &lt;- c("Hans", "Sille", "Bo")  # character vector
people &lt;- data.frame(Name = name, Age = age)  # data frame
people  # print object
```

```
##    Name Age
## 1  Hans  12
## 2 Sille  56
## 3    Bo  34
```

```r
people[1,]  # subsetting
```

```
##   Name Age
## 1 Hans  12
```

```r
people$Name  # column Name
```

```
## [1] Hans  Sille Bo   
## Levels: Bo Hans Sille
```

---

## R basics


```r
lst &lt;- list(p = people, status = 0, log = "Okay")  # a list (most abstract object)
lst
```

```
## $p
##    Name Age
## 1  Hans  12
## 2 Sille  56
## 3    Bo  34
## 
## $status
## [1] 0
## 
## $log
## [1] "Okay"
```

- The most commonly used way to store data is using a data frame, where each row represents an observation, and each column a variable.

---

## Your Turn

.your-turn[

Use R to 

- Extract column `Age` from `people`.
- Extract the age of Hans from `people`.
- Use `class` to find the data type of `p` in `lst`.
- Why does this code not work?
```r
x &lt;- 2
Y &lt;- 4
x + y
```
- Define a list with a vector, a number, a string and a boolean.

```
## $v
## [1] 1 2

## $n
## [1] 3

## Functions

- A function have inputs and outputs.
- Functions are often used to encapsulate a sequence of expressions that need to be executed numerous times, perhaps under slightly different conditions. 
- In programming, functional programming is a programming paradigm, a style how code is written. Rather than repeating code, functions and control structures allow one to build code in blocks. 
- Functions are (often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses.


```r
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

---

## Your Turn

.your-turn[

- Create a vector `v` with numbers 2, 4, 6, 8 [see the help for function `seq` by writing `?seq` in the console and having a look at the examples]. 
- What is the sum of `v`?
- What is the sum of the numbers in `x &lt;- c(1:4, NA)` [see `?sum`]?
- Does `x` contain a missing value (`NA`) [see `?is.na`]
- Convert `s &lt;- "1.2"` to a number [see `?as.numeric`].
- What is the return value of `class(x)`?
- Set `y &lt;- NULL` and check if `y` is null [see `?NULL`]. 
- Set `lst &lt;- list(x = 3, y = "foo")` and check if `lst` contains an object `z` [use `is.null`].

## R packages

- In R, the fundamental unit of shareable code is the package.
- As of April 2020, there are over 15,000 packages available on the **C**omprehensive **R** **A**rchive **N**etwork (CRAN), the public clearing house for R packages. 
- This huge variety of packages is one reason why R is so successful: the chances are that someone has already solved a problem that you’re working on, and you can benefit from their work by downloading their package.
- Using R packages:
  - Install them from CRAN with `install.packages("x")`.
  - Install from GitHub using `remotes::install_github(path)`.
  - Use them in R with `library(x)` or `x::&lt;function&gt;`.
  - Use `?x` the see the help pages.

---

## Pipes

Use the pipe `%&gt;%` operator for expressing a sequence of multiple operations (Ctrl+Shift+M). Value `log2(sqrt(16))` using pipes:

```r
library(tidyverse)   # define the pipe operator
x &lt;- 16
x %&gt;% sqrt() %&gt;% log2()
```

```
## [1] 2
```
The pipe _sends_ the result of the left side of the pipe to be the first argument of the function on the right side of the pipe. 

$$ \mbox{original data (x)}
\rightarrow \mbox{ sqrt }
\rightarrow \mbox{ log2 } $$

That is, we take what is left of the arrow (the object `x`) and put it into the function on the right of the arrow. 

---

## Your Turn

.your-turn[
Use pipes to calculate 


```r
x &lt;- c(1:4, NA, 34)
x &lt;- x^2
x &lt;- sum(x, na.rm = TRUE)
x &lt;- sqrt(x)
x
```
