This site/book contains course notes for the R part of the course "Tools for Analytics" held at [BSS]. The notes organize what we will be doing in each week. The course is an introductory course at the [Operations and Supply Chain Analytics programme][osca-programme] and intended to give knowledge about IT tools for Analytics. 

Since the amount of available data has increased extensively in many companies, there is a need for analysts with the ability to do tasks within Analytics. For instance, extract relevant data and perform valid quantitative analysis. Clearly, it is also important that the analyst can communicate the results of the analysis to their surroundings. This requires for the analyst to be particularly qualified in handling IT based tools beyond e.g. basic Excel. 
<!-- The use of programming is the basis for performing a variety of analytical tasks including impact studies, risk analysis, and design of reports. -->

Business Analytics (BA) (or just Analytics) refers to the scientific process of transforming data into insight for making better decisions in business. BA can both be seen as the complete decision making process for solving a business problem and the creation of business value by integration of concepts, methods and data. As a process, it can be characterized by descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive model building using data sources. For a full definition see the [appendix](#sec:ba).

Within a Business Analytics (BA) framework the course focus on giving you an introduction to programming, handeling data and doing descriptive analytics. Descriptive analytics categorizes, characterizes, consolidates, and classifies data. Examples are standard reporting and dashboards (key performance indicators (KPIs), what happened or is happening now?) and ad-hoc reporting (how many/often?). Descriptive analytics often serves as a first step in the successful application of predictive or prescriptive analytics. Predictive and prescriptive analytics are covered in other courses of the [programme][osca-programme].

Analytics may be seen as a data driven process:

```

<!-- Tidying your data also including cleaning your data.  -->

For doing data driven analytics you first must __import__ your data. That is, take data from a database, file, web API etc. and transform it into a data frame/table. In general raw data may be messy and need to be structured in a __tidy__ way. Tidying your data means storing it in a structured form sutaiable for analysis. In brief, when your data is __tidy__, each column is a variable, and each row is an observation. Tidy data is important because the consistent structure lets you focus your struggle on questions about the data. 
Once you have tidy data, a common first step is to __transform__ it. Transformation includes narrowing in on observations of interest (e.g. only observations from a specific year or warehouse), creating new variables based on existing variables (like the cost of using the machine that day given idle time). Together, tidying and transforming are called __wrangling__, because 
it can be a hard process to get your data in the right form.

The next step is to do a simple __exploration__ of you data such as calculating a set of summary statistics (like counts, means or KPIs). A good way to get an overview over your data is by __visualisation__. A good visualisation will show you things that you did not expect, raise new questions about the data or confirm your hypotesis. A good visualisation might also hint that you're asking the wrong question, or you need to collect different data. Exploration and visusalization are descriptive analytics and used to answer questions such as: What happend? How many, how often, where? Where exactly is the problem? What actions are needed?
__Models__ are complementary tools to visualisation. Once you have made your questions sufficiently precise, you can use a model to answer them. A model is a description of a system using mathematical concepts and a simplification of the real system. That is, the results of a model are based on a set of assumptions. Models for statistical analysis, forecasting, system behaivior are predictive analytics and answer questions like: Why is this happening? What if these trends continue? What will happen next? Models for prescriptive analytics use optimization and other decision modelling techniques to suggest decision options with the goal of improving business performance and answer questions like: What is the best that can happen?

Exploration, visualizaton and modeling may be seen as different steps which can be used for __analyzing__ the data and answer the overall questions. This part of the course will focus on the different steps except modeling. 

Given an analysis, __communication__ is an absolutely critical part. It doesn't matter how well your models and visualization have led you to understand the data unless you can also communicate your results to decision makers. 

Note that analytics is not a one-way process, is is common that you several times have to tidy and transform your data, explore and visualize based on the results of a model, rerun the model given feedback on you communication to the decision makers etc. Common connections are visualized using directed arrows in Figure \@ref(fig:process). 

Surrounding the process is __programming__. Programming is the Swiss army knife you use during parts of the process. An introduction to programming is given in the first part of the course using VBA in Excel. We will cover programming using R in this part of the course.


## How this book is organised

[Færdiggøres]

The book consists of different parts each containing teaching modules about a specific topic:

   * [Part I](#sec-install) focus on helping you install the needed programs on your computer and give you a short introduction to R.
   * In [Part II](#sec-loops) gives you an overview over programming in R including loops, conditionals and functions.
   * In [Part III](#sec-tidy-intro) the focus is on import/export, tidy and transformation of data.
   * [Part IV](#sec-plot) considers visualization of data in R. 
   * [Part V](#sec-project) presents your mandatory R project.
   * [Part VI](#sec-r-excel) contains extra modules not part of the curriculum in this course. But it may be useful during your study.
   
   
In all parts communication are considered ...


You can expect the book to be updated when the course runs. The date listed above is the last time this guide was updated.

The R part of the course covers learning goals:

* explore, groom, visualize, and analyze data,
* make all of that reproducible, reusable, and shareable,
* using R.
