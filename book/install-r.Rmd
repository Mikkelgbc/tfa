## Learning outcomes {#lo-install}

By the end of this module, you are expected to have:

* Installed R.
* Installed RStudio.
<!-- * Installed Git. -->
* Tested R and RStudio. <!--  and Git. -->
* Installed some packages.

## Install R and RStudio {#install-r}

[R] is a programming language and free software environment. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. For a further overview and description of the history of R see [Chapter 2](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/history-and-overview-of-r.html) in @rdpeng. To run R you need to install it on your computer. Moreover, you need the IDE (integrated development environment) [RStudio], to save your work.



<div class = "boxTask">
`r addIcon("tasks", attrib = list(class = "fa-pull-right fa-5x iconStyle1"))`  

* Install R from [CRAN][cran] (Comprehensive R Archive Network). Install the latest precompiled binary distribution for your operating system (use the links up at the top of the CRAN page)!
* Install the desktop version of [RStudio][rstudio-download], a powerful user interface for R. 
<!-- * Install the latest version of [Git][git-install]. If you have problems, see [here][hg-install-git]. -->
* Under Windows it is a good idea to always open R with administrator rights: 
   - Add a shortcut for RStudio (e.g. to the taskbar or desktop).
   - Ctrl+Shift+Right-Click the shortcut and choose **Properties**:
     ![Choose Properties](img/win_admin1.png)
   - Under **Shortcut** click **Advanced** and set **Run as administrator** 
     ![Choose Properties](img/win_admin3.png)
     
     You now always can open RStudio with this shortcut. 
</div>
    
If you have a pre-existing installation of R and/or RStudio, reinstall both to the latest versions. It can be considerably harder to run old software than new. To update your R version you may use the [intallr](https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/pandoc/installr.html) package.


## Test your installation

<div class = "boxTask">`r addIcon("tasks", attrib = list(class = "fa-pull-right fa-5x iconStyle1"))`  

* Do whatever is appropriate for your OS to launch RStudio. You should get a window similar to the screenshot you see [here][rstudio-workbench], but yours will be more boring because you haven't written any code or made any figures yet!

* Put your cursor in the pane labeled Console, which is where you interact with the live R process. Create a simple object with code like `x <- 2 * 4` (followed by enter or return). Then inspect the `x` object by typing `x` followed by enter or return. You should see the value 8 print to screen. If yes, you've succeeded in installing R and RStudio.

* Try to open a new file **File > New File > New RMarkdown...**. Use the defaults and press **OK**. Next save the file and compile it using **Knit** (Ctrl+Shift+K). You have now compiled a document with R code inside of it. 

<!-- * Close and restart R. Go to **Tools > Global Options > Git/SVN **. The 'Git executable' field should point to the path where Git is installed. On windows the path looks like `C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe` and on macOS and Linux, the path usually looks something like `/usr/bin/git`. If the field is not filled with a path, have a look at [Chapter 13](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-see-git.html) and [14](https://happygitwithr.com/troubleshooting.html) at the [Happy Git][happy-git] site. -->

## Add-on packages

R is an extensible system and many people share useful code they have developed as a _package_ via CRAN and GitHub. To install a package from CRAN, for example the [dplyr][dplyr-cran] package for data manipulation, one way to do it in the R console.

```r
install.packages("dplyr", dependencies = TRUE)
```

By including `dependencies = TRUE`, we are being explicit and extra-careful to install any additional packages the target package, `dplyr` in the example above, needs to have around. 

<div class = "boxTask">
`r addIcon("tasks", attrib = list(class = "fa-pull-right fa-5x iconStyle1"))`  

* Install the package [tidyverse][tidyverse-main-page] which is in fact a bundle of packages by running (note this operation may take a long time):

```r
install.packages("tidyverse", dependencies = TRUE)
```

* Check if you have successfully installed tidyverse by loading the package:

```r
library(tidyverse)
```

* If your install was unsuccessful try to install the packages who fails one at a time.
